In this project, I will be working as a data scientist for a new analytical company interested in monitoring and analyzing news on social media platforms.

One of the most popular platform is Twitter now X, which has become an important communication in terms of emergency.

The company has given us a project in which they want us to build a deep learning text classification model that predicts which tweets are about real disaster and which are not.
